# Pathway Builder
Camino™ is a prototype SMART on FHIR application intended to demonstrate the value of mCODE™, a standardized data model around cancer, through computable oncology clinical pathways. Camino uses mCODE data in the patient's record fetched from the EHR to automatically evaluate the patient's current location on a structured pathway and provides recommendations as to next steps. [See a live demo](https://mcode.github.io/pathway-builder/#/demo)

## Clinical Pathways
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO®) defines oncology clinical pathways as "detailed, evidence-based treatment protocols for delivering cancer care to patients with specific disease types and stages. When properly designed and implemented, oncology pathways can serve as an important tool in improving care quality and reducing costs." Read more about clinical pathways at https://www.asco.org/practice-policy/cancer-care-initiatives/clinical-pathways

## mCODE: Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements
mCODE is an initiative intended to assemble a core set of structured data elements for oncology electronic health records (EHRs). mCODE is a step towards capturing research-quality data from the treatment of all cancer patients. This would enable the treatment of every cancer patient to contribute to comparative effectiveness analysis of cancer treatments by allowing for easier methods of data exchange between health systems. mCODE has been created and is being supported by ASCO in collaboration with the MITRE Corporation.

## FHIR: Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
HL7® FHIR® is a rapidly growing standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. Read more about FHIR at http://hl7.org/fhir/summary.html

## CQL: Clinical Quality Language
Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a high-level, domain-specific language focused on clinical quality and targeted at measure and decision support artifact authors. Camino uses CQL in its pathway definitions to enable automated identification of what has . Read more about CQL at https://cql.hl7.org/

## Running tests
Tests can be run by executing:
```shell script
yarn test
```

## Running the code linter
Code linting can be run by executing:

```shell script
yarn lint
```

Some issues can be automatically corrected with:

```shell script
yarn lint-fix
```
